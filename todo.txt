TODO, priority list

- architect how the instances get generated, possibly w/ generator funcs instead of hard-coded
- get recursive data-types in there
- classes
- run on the `learn` function
- learn about containers & set up sandboxing
- set up a nice interfact to interact w. the tool & maybe some automation



- find motivating example codebases
- write instance functions to cover more types
- pull out of jupypter into script
   ie, workflow is: pass in module, or file (as long as all deps are present) or name of function
- test cases



December 19th, plan of action:
1. find (simple) codebase
2. use that to rearchitect the code
3. write tests
4. work on extentions
