Todo:
- Get types from type definitions and use these to limit search space
- Get default parameters from named parameters in functions and use these
- Result printing for classes
- Multiple successful class instances
- Once we have a set of benchmarkss, make sure performance is acceptable / improve search strategies
- Smarter search: search based on exception types (ie put in mock object, look for "class Dummy has no Meow method")
- Maybe instrument branches to ensure we're hitting all branches


Also handle:
- Side-effects (ie network)
- Infinite loops
- Runaway memory useage
- Var arg & keyword arg signatures
- Recursive data structures: run on `learn` function
